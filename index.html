    <h1>Orchid Care 101</h1>
    <h2>Learning how to care for the Phalaenopsis Orchid</h2>
    <p>While Phalaenopsis Orchids, <em>also known as Moth Orchids,</em> are usually known as finnicky plants, you can learn how to care for them so they thrive.</p>
    <p>They may seem like an intimidating plant to make happy, but as long as you follow some simple care requirements you will have a thriving plant.</p>
    <h3>Step by step guide:</h3>
    <p> <strong>Light:</strong> Place your orchid in a location with bright, indirect light. Avoid direct sunlight as it can burn the leaves. East or west-facing windows are usually ideal.

<p> <strong>Temperature:</strong> Moth orchids prefer temperatures between 65째F to 85째F (18째C to 29째C) during the day and slightly cooler temperatures at night. Protect them from drafts and temperature extremes.</p>

<p> <strong>Watering:</strong> Water your orchid thoroughly once a week, allowing the water to flow freely through the potting medium. Ensure the pot has drainage holes to prevent waterlogging. Let the top inch of the potting mix dry out before watering again.</p>

<p> <strong>Humidity:</strong> Orchids appreciate higher humidity levels. You can increase humidity by placing the pot on a tray filled with pebbles and water, misting the leaves occasionally, or using a humidifier.</p>

<p> <strong>Potting medium:</strong> Moth orchids are typically potted in a loose, well-draining medium such as bark chips or sphagnum moss. Repot the orchid every one to two years using fresh orchid potting mix.</p>

<p> <strong>Fertilization:</strong> Use a balanced orchid fertilizer diluted to half strength and feed your orchid every two to four weeks during the growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or stop fertilizing during the winter months.</p>

<p> <strong>Air circulation:</strong> Good air circulation is essential for preventing fungal and bacterial infections. Avoid overcrowding your orchids and ensure there is space between them to promote airflow.</p>

<p> <strong>Pruning:</strong> Remove spent flower spikes by cutting them back to the base of the plant. Trim any dead or yellowing leaves or roots. Be careful when cutting to avoid damaging healthy tissue.</p>

<p> <strong>Rest period:</strong> Moth orchids may enter a rest period after blooming, during which they might not produce new flowers. This period can last a few weeks to a few months. Continue caring for your orchid as usual, and it should start blooming again when ready. <strong><em>*You did not kill your Orchid if it stops blooming! This is a natural part of it's cycle as a healthy plant.*</em></strong> </p>

<p> <strong>Observation:</strong> Regularly inspect your orchid for any signs of pests, such as mealybugs or scale. If you notice any infestation, treat it promptly with an appropriate insecticide or by physically removing the pests.</p>

<p>Remember that orchids can vary in their care requirements, so it's always beneficial to research specific care instructions for the particular variety of moth orchid you have.</p>
